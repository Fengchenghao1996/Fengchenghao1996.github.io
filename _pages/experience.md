* **University of Texas at Austin, USA**
  * Research Assistant, ECE department, University of Texas at Austin, June 2019 - Present, Austin, TX
  * Designed novel architecture for area-efficient optical neural network based on Fast Fourier Transformation; achieved 3-4x area reduction than previous ONN architectures; Wrote academic paper that was published in IEEE/ACM ASP-DAC, Jan 2020.
  * Developed noise-aware quantization scheme to enable robust optical neural networks with low-precision voltage controls; achieved better accuracy and robustness to limited control resolution and device-level variations than previous methods; Wrote academic paper that was published in DATE, Mar 2020.
  * Proposed efficient on-chip learning algorithm for optical neural networks with stochastic zeroth-order optimization algorithms; achieved 3-4x higher ONN forward efficiency and better robustness to thermal variation than previous methods.
  * Worked on photonic chip tapeout for novel ONN architectures with synopsys optodesigner.
  * Collaborated on the design of photonic recurrent neural networks.
  * Helped develop high-performance CUDA kernels for ASIC global and detailed placement acceleration with GPUs.

* **University of Texas at Austin, USA**
